# Web-API-Interaction-Project-Timeslot-Management-System

Implemented a web-based system for efficient timeslot management.
Developed a server-side application (host) and a client-side Python script for creating timeslots.
The server, built using Spring Boot, facilitates robust timeslot creation, storage, and retrieval.
The Python client script interacts with the server, allowing users to seamlessly create timeslots with specified details.
Leveraged Python the requests library for HTTP interactions, and the built-in datetime library for time calculations.
